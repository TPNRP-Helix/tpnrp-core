# TPNRP Core Documentation

This directory contains the Docusaurus documentation site for TPNRP Core.

## Development

To develop locally, first install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Then start the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

This starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

## Build

To create a production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

## Serve

To preview the production build locally:

```bash
npm run serve
```

## Deployment

Deploy the `build` folder to your hosting service of choice (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, etc.).
